      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p id="fake-bio">
        This is the part of my assignment where I struggled the most (except for
        those damn @mediaqueries!) Who here actually enjoys writing about
        themselves? ðŸ˜° Anyway.. here goes!
      </p>
      <p id="actual-bio-1">
        Hi! My name is Hannah-Beth Hannah-Becker (and no, that's not a typo - I
        know my own name thank you very much! ðŸ¤ª) ....I hope *existensial crisis
        ensues*
        <br />I moved to Perth, WA at the end of 2019 and absolutely love it
        here. <br />Personally, I've always had a passion for software
        development and technology in general, having completed certifications
        in Front-End Development and Network Administration. I even read a
        Python book front to back during lockdown in 2020. <br />However! As is
        typical for women in technology, I never felt confident enough to pursue
        a career in this field.
      </p>
      <p id="actual-bio-2">
        To scratch the "technical itch", I joined Hays Recruitment as a
        consultant in Feb 2020 and have been working with candidates to help
        them find their new role in tech ever since (with a particular focus on
        securing strong female candidates roles!).
        <br />As time has gone on, and I've helped more and more people secure
        the job or their dreams, I've realised this is truly what I'm passionate
        about, solution design, problem solving and ..coding!
      </p>
      <p id="actual-bio-3">
        <bold>ðŸš€ 2022 and beyond:</bold> I joined the Australian She Codes
        program in November 2021, with the hopes to meet other like-minded women
        who want to pick up new skills, or even move into technical roles
        themselves. <br />I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. Watch
        this space! ðŸ˜‰
