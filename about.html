                This is the part I always struggle with the most (except writing
                those damn @mediaqueries!) Who here actually enjoys writing
                about themselves? 😰 Anyway.. here goes!
              </p>

                Hi! My name is Hannah-Beth Hannah-Becker (and no, that's not a
                typo - I know my own name! 🤪) ....I hope *existensial crisis
                ensues*
                <br />I moved to Perth, WA at the end of 2019 and absolutely
                love it here. <br />Personally, I've always had a passion for
                software development and technology in general, having completed
                certifications in Front-End Development and Network
                Administration. I even read a Python book front to back during
                lockdown in 2020. <br />However! As is typical for women in
                technology, I never felt confident enough to pursue a career in
                this field.
              </p>
              <p>
                To scratch the "technical itch", I joined Hays Recruitment as a
                consultant in Feb 2020 and have been working with candidates to
                help them find their new role in tech ever since (with a
                particular focus on securing strong female candidates roles!).
                <br />As time has gone on, and I've helped more and more people
                secure the job of their dreams, I've realised this is truly what
                I'm passionate about, problem solving and ..coding! 👩‍💻

            <bold>🚀 2022 and beyond:</bold> I joined the Australian She Codes
            program in November 2021, with the hopes to meet other like-minded
            women who want to pick up new skills, or even move into technical
            roles themselves. <br />I can't wait to see where this journey takes
            me. Watch this space! 😉
