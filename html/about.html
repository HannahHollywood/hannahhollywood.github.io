            This is the part of my assignment where I struggled the most (except
            for those damn @mediaqueries!) Who here actually enjoys writing
            about themselves? 😰 Anyway.. here goes!
          </p>

            Hi! My name is Hannah-Beth Hannah-Becker (and no, that's not a typo
            - I know my own name thank you very much! 🤪) ....I hope
            *existensial crisis ensues*
            <br />I moved to Perth, WA at the end of 2019 and absolutely love it
            here. <br />Personally, I've always had a passion for software
            development and technology in general, having completed
            certifications in Front-End Development and Network Administration.
            I even read a Python book front to back during lockdown in 2020.
            <br />However! As is typical for women in technology, I never felt
            confident enough to pursue a career in this field.
          </p>
          <p>
            To scratch the "technical itch", I joined Hays Recruitment as a
            consultant in Feb 2020 and have been working with candidates to help
            them find their new role in tech ever since (with a particular focus
            on securing strong female candidates roles!).
            <br />As time has gone on, and I've helped more and more people
            secure the job of their dreams, I've realised this is truly what I'm
            passionate about, problem solving and ..coding! 👩‍💻

        <bold>🚀 2022 and beyond:</bold> I joined the Australian She Codes
        program in November 2021, with the hopes to meet other like-minded women
        who want to pick up new skills, or even move into technical roles
        themselves. <br />I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. Watch
        this space! 😉
