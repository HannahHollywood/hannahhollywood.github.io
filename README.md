Making sure git is happy!

---

👆 The above comment from 2 years ago was me first learning about how to push to git! How cute 🥹

👉 This project was my first 'Portfolio Website' created during my time in the She Codes Australia program (2022).
👉 We were tasked with using HTML, CSS and @mediaqueries to create a 'dynamic webpage'. Students were allowed to use some basic JavaScript if they wanted to add some "pizzazz" to the page.
-- (No other frameworks were allowed to be used (eg. Bootstrap) so as you can see, I properly struggled with CSS and @mediaqueries haha!)

👩‍💻 Current updates to this repo will include improvements to @mediaqueries and styling changes as part of WA Tafe.

💜 This page will be replaced with a React/TypeScript portfolio page in the near future.
